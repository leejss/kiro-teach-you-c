/*
 * Number Guessing Game - Loops and Conditions
 * 
 * This is a classic C programming exercise that demonstrates:
 * - while loops for repetition
 * - Conditional statements for game logic
 * - User input validation
 * - Loop control with break and continue
 * 
 * This type of interactive program is a staple of C programming
 * education and shows practical use of control structures.
