# Product Overview

**Mstart C Language** is an educational project designed for realistic, practical learning of C programming through real-world examples that frontend developers can relate to.

## Target Audience

- Frontend engineers with 3+ years of experience
- Developers wanting to understand low-level programming concepts
- Those seeking to bridge the gap between high-level and systems programming
- Engineers curious about how browsers, Node.js, and web servers work internally

## Learning Approach

- **Basic to Advanced Progression**: Start with simple concepts, build to complex systems
- **Realistic Examples**: Every example solves real problems or demonstrates practical concepts
- **Frontend Context**: Relate C concepts to familiar JavaScript/web development patterns
- **Hands-On Projects**: Build actual tools and applications, not just toy programs

## Core Philosophy

Learn C through practical examples that mirror real-world scenarios. Instead of abstract exercises, build tools like JSON parsers, HTTP servers, and memory allocators that demonstrate how the technologies you use daily actually work under the hood.

## Example Progression

- **Basics**: Start with program structure, then build a simple calculator
- **Intermediate**: Create text processors and file handlers (like build tools)
- **Advanced**: Implement data structures and system utilities
- **Projects**: Build complete applications like web servers and parsers

Each lesson answers: "How does this relate to what I already know?" and "When would I use this in practice?"
